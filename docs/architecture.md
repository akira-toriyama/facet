# facet — architecture

facet is a Swift workspace + window manager for macOS. The split
into **Core / Adapter / View** is the central design idea: the
same pure-logic core can drive multiple UI surfaces (tree sidebar,
full-screen overview grid, future docks/hovers), and the same UI
works against the native AX / CGS backend (`FacetAdapterNative`).
The `WindowBackend` protocol seam stays in place as a unit-test
stub seam.

`FacetCore` defines two adapter ports: `WindowBackend` (workspaces,
move, focus, switch, layout, display, event stream, …) — single
implementation today (`FacetAdapterNative`), seam preserved for
unit-test stubs (`StubBackend` in `BackendTests`) — and
`WindowCapturing` (per-window image capture for the overview
thumbnails + tree hover preview), implemented by `SCKWindowCapture`
(ScreenCaptureKit, macOS 14+) in the `FacetCapture` adapter. Capture
is a distinct backend axis (different OS framework, separate Screen
Recording grant, optional / version-gated), so it lives in its own
module rather than folded into `FacetAdapterNative`. Returning a
`CGImage` (not `NSImage`) keeps the port AppKit-free; the view layer
wraps it for drawing — so `FacetView` imports no OS capture backend.

## Why three layers, not two

- **Test surface**: `FacetCore` is pure logic, fully exercised in
  `Tests/FacetCoreTests` without any AppKit. Adapters get contract
  tests by feeding canned event streams. Views are GUI-only — kept
  thin, no business logic.
- **Backend swap**: the `Native` adapter starts as a stub and grows
  in Phases α–ε without ever breaking the views. When it's solid,
  `Rift` adapter is retired (without modifying any view code).
- **Multiple views over the same state**: tree and grid are two
  facets of the same workspace model. Future views (hover-bar,
  dock-bar, command palette, etc.) plug in without touching Core
  or Adapter.

## Milestones

| Phase | Goal | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | Repo scaffolded, multi-target Package.swift builds | `swift build` / `swift test` green |
| **M2** | tree + grid views + CLI working (originally via rift adapter, retired at ε) | tree + grid panels render against live backend |
| **M3** | Homebrew tap entry (under existing `akira-toriyama/homebrew-tap`) | `brew install akira-toriyama/tap/facet` works |
| **M5** | Native adapter Phase α–ε. All five phases shipped (α/β/γ.1/γ.2/γ.3/δ/ε); v2.0.0 retired rift, native is the only backend | see below |
| **M6–M11** | **Polish → window mgmt → WS ops → macOS 26 (tag / scrollable).** M6 brushup done; **M7 is a numbering gap**; **M8 window management is code-complete (2026-06-02)** — themes A–D incl. rail (#109), marks / sticky / scratchpad, real-window DnD + resize, cheap tiling verbs; **M9 (WS ops + view unification) shipped (#139 / #140 / #142)**; **M10 is a numbering gap (abolished 2026-06-02)**; **M11 (macOS 26 era)** folds in the tag model (M11-3, **shipped #191**) + scrolling columns (M11-4, not yet shipped) | `facet-future-roadmap` memory is canonical + "Themes A–D" below |

## Native adapter phases

The SIP-enable boundary is firm: facet runs in user space, using
only public APIs + Accessibility. No yabai-style injection. This
matches how rift / aerospace operate today.

| Phase | Scope | Reference reading |
|---|---|---|
| **α** | virtual workspace concept self-managed; focus tracking. **Frozen 2026-05-24, shipped 2026-05-26**: (b) hybrid model (mac desktop × facet workspace), default 5 WS dynamic, hide method = `anchor` (1×41 px corner park), CLI = `facet workspace --focus N` (α 期の flag は `--workspace=N`、Theme C #81/#82 で subject-verb 化). Workspace state + reconcile + focusedWindow + AX-driven event subscription | rift `workspace` module, AeroSpace `MacWindow.hideInCorner` |
| **β** | window move across workspaces; off-screen park/unpark; closeWindow. **Shipped 2026-05-26**: anchor hide / closeWindow + windowMenu Close | rift `wm/window`, yabai window mgmt |
| **γ** | window tiling (BSP / stack layout engines). **Frozen 2026-05-26; γ.1 / γ.2 / γ.3 all shipped (PR #44 / #45 / #46)**: BSP + stack only, always-on auto-tile, auto-balance split, lazy retile, per-WS mode (default `"float"`), `LayoutTree` value type, 5 CLI verbs, AX-role auto-float for sheets / dialogs / palettes | rift `layout`, AeroSpace tree |
| **δ** | display reconfigure handling; persistence-aware geometry (no new state). **Frozen + shipped 2026-05-27 (PR #53)**: `didChangeScreenParameters` listener, active WS re-tile, anchor-parked rescue to nearest visible display, panel snap to nearest display, pure helpers in `DisplayGeometry`. Single-display dev environment so multi-display polish is rescue-helpers-only | — |
| **ε** | `FacetAdapterRift` retire; native becomes the only backend. **Frozen + shipped 2026-05-27 (v2.0.0 major bump)**: rift module deleted, `FACET_BACKEND` env var removed (kept as warning hint only), `WindowBackend` protocol preserved for unit-test stub seam. M5 completes here. | — |

Each phase is gated by being usable end-to-end through the view layer
— no Phase α–δ landings ship unless the existing UI still works
against them.

## Themes A–D (M8 window management, shipped 2026-06-02)

M5 shipped at v2.0.0 (themes stocked 2026-05-27). **All four themes
below shipped under M8** (#72 / #73–80 / #81–82 / rail #109), each
after a grill round (Phase γ/δ/ε pattern; see the Status column). M8
also shipped the stocked slots — window marks (#118/#119), sticky
(#128/#129), scratchpad (#135), real-window DnD (#122–124) + resize
(#125/#127), cheap tiling verbs (#115/#117). The forward roadmap is
**M9** (WS ops + view unification, shipped #139 / #140 / #142) then
**M11** (macOS 26 era) — which folds in the tag model (M11-3,
shipped #191) + scrolling columns (M11-4, not yet shipped).
**M7 and M10 are numbering gaps.**
Canonical: `facet-future-roadmap` memory.

| Theme | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Tree DnD parity** | Tree view で WS / window DnD reorder (grid view と同等機能) | ✅ shipped (#72) |
| **B. Extended layouts** | Centered Master (3-column, ultrawide 向け) / Scrolling columns (niri 風) を Phase γ の `bsp` + `stack` に追加 | ✅ shipped (#73–80) — monocle / tall / centered-master / grid / spiral + master ops。命名整理は #108 (monocle→stack 統合・centered-master→centered) 経て **M9-2 で master 5 辺化に確定**: `master-left` / `master-right` / `master-top` / `master-bottom` / `master-center` + grid / spiral (tall/wide/centered は破壊的リネーム・`--toggle-orientation` の master flip 廃止)。scrolling columns (niri 風) は未実装 (M11-4) |
| **C. CLI redesign** | yabai 流の豊富 parameter 設計を参考に、整合性 / 一貫性を最優先で再設計。 **破壊的変更 OK** (トミー明示) | ✅ shipped (#81 / #82) — `facet workspace` / `window` subject-verb |
| **D. New view types** | 当初候補 (i) 自由配置 canvas Google Maps 風 / (ii) WS DnD reorder Mission Control 風 はいずれも却下 → 別案 **rail view** (全画面 WS overview バー) を採用 | ✅ shipped as `facet --view rail` (#109) |

着手前 invariants: `facet-buddha-palm-principle` (OS 尊重) を壊さない / `facet-scope-exclusions` (15 not-do) と矛盾しない / `WindowBackend` protocol 経由設計を維持 (unit-test stub seam を壊さない)。

### Phase α frozen decisions (2026-05-24)

Phase α design is fully decided. Details live in memory; this list
is the index. **Do not relitigate** without explicit grill round.

- **Workspace model**: (b) rift-style hybrid (mac desktop × facet
  workspace, 2 dimensions). Window-unit management (not app-rules).
  Default 5 WS per mac desktop; dynamic add/remove/rename/move at
  runtime via `facet workspace --add` / `--remove` / `--rename` /
  `--move`. Workspaces are auto-named (emoji pool) — there is no
  config-side naming; `--rename` owns the name at runtime.
- **Per-mac-desktop workspaces**: each mac desktop keeps an
  independent set of facet workspaces (own `WorkspaceCatalog`,
  parked/swapped on mac-desktop switch). The active mac-desktop id + ordinal
  are read read-only via private SkyLight (`MacDesktops`,
  `SLSGetActiveSpace` / `SLSCopyManagedDisplaySpaces`); facet never
  moves windows across mac desktops, so it stays SIP-on / public-contract
  (the rejected cross-mac-desktop move was hide 手法4). `[[desktop.N.section]]`
  config customises a mac desktop by Mission-Control ordinal — an ordered
  list of `type = workspace | lens` sections (workspace =
  auto-named cell + optional `layout`; the count sets the WS count). EX-3:
  `WindowSlot.workspace` is `Int?` — a window can belong to NO workspace
  (`workspace = 0 or 1`); dragging it onto a lens relocates it out of its
  workspace (`orphanWindow`), and an orphan (迷子) is invisible-but-logged
  until a `type = "lens"` receptacle (`match = 'not workspace'`) gathers it
  (no `unassigned` type — that's deferred). Catalog state is session-only. Opt-in: any `[[desktop.N.section]]` → facet
  manages only configured mac desktops, others hands-off (panel hidden);
  none → all mac desktops managed by default. SkyLight gone → single shared
  catalog. Memory: facet-per-native-space-ws. (This supersedes the
  earlier "mac desktop co-use discouraged" stance — facet now nests
  under mac desktops by design.)
- **Hide method**: 7 candidates evaluated; only `anchor` (1×41 px
  corner park) is used — instant, no animation, recoverable from
  Mission Control. `minimize` (Dock genie) was trialed then
  dropped (the genie animation makes workspace switching feel
  slow); no config knob remains, `anchor` is unconditional. True
  hide (MC/Cmd-Tab disappearance) is impossible in public API —
  out of scope for facet. A genuine *user* hide (Cmd+H / Cmd+M →
  `isOnscreen=false`) gives up the window's tile slot so neighbours
  reclaim it (`WorkspaceCatalog.reconcileHidden`); the window keeps
  its WS assignment + marks, shows dimmed with a `hidden` badge in the
  tree, and re-attaches at the tail when it returns on-screen (click
  restores via `WindowBackend.revealWindow`). facet's own anchor park
  keeps `isOnscreen` true, so only user hides trigger this (#131 /
  #132 / #133; memory `facet-hide-reclaim-decisions`).
- **CLI surface**: `facet workspace --focus N` switch, `facet window
  --move-to N` move, `--reload` explicit + auto FSEvents watcher,
  `facet query` for state dump. Subject-verb form since Theme C
  (#81/#82); the α-era top-level `--workspace=N` was deleted. TOML
  atomic write enforced in shipped templates.
  - **Grammar is an isolated seam (#227)**: the CLI uses yabai-style
    space-separated values (`--flag VALUE`, never `--flag=VALUE`).
    The pure parser type `ArgCursor` (per-flag *strict consumption*)
    lives in `FacetCore` (`Sources/FacetCore/CLIParse.swift`) so it is
    unit-testable without AppKit; the FacetApp client layer (`Main.swift`
    + `FacetApp+Client*.swift`) drives it and owns the impure exit /
    stderr shell. It translates argv into the canonical DNC
    control strings (`view:tree+active`, `tag-rename:OLD:NEW`, …) that
    `FacetCore` / the adapter consume — so the grammar can change
    without touching the core (the DNC payloads stayed byte-identical
    across the `=`→space migration). `facet query` likewise absorbed
    the former `facet status` verb with no change to the on-disk
    snapshot. The CLI parser is to the grammar what `WindowBackend`
    is to the backend: a port that keeps the hexagon's interior
    stable while the outside world changes.
- **Shortcut**: out of scope. README recommends skhd / Karabiner /
  hammerspoon (compose-friendly, like yabai + skhd).
- **New window detection**: per-app AX subscription via
  `WindowEventObserver` (pattern lifted from [focusfx]). Wires
  `kAXFocusedWindowChanged` + `kAXWindowCreated` +
  `kAXUIElementDestroyed` on every running app, folded with
  `NSWorkspace` launch / terminate. Public AX notifications are
  the OS-blessed seam — not a self-hook in the buddha-palm sense
  (`facet-buddha-palm-principle`); that line is reserved for
  swizzling / private SLS injection.
- **Multi-display**: independent WS sets per display. Untested
  (developer has 1 display).
- **Fullscreen apps**: excluded from facet management, left to
  macOS.
- **Persistence**: not in facet. WS names are not persisted —
  workspaces are auto-named (emoji pool); a `[[desktop.N.section]]`
  block only seeds the WS count + per-WS `layout` (read-only). Runtime
  rename / layout / catalog mutations are all session-only.
- **Startup**: don't touch existing windows. The first `type=workspace`
  section (or WS index 1 with no section config) is the initial
  [active section](#two-tiling-machineries-one-active-section); no windows
  move on startup. **Shutdown**: restore all hidden windows (treat shutdown
  = workspace feature OFF).

### Phase γ frozen decisions (2026-05-26)

Phase γ design is fully decided. Details live in memory
(`facet-phase-gamma-decisions`); this list is the index. **Do
not relitigate** without explicit grill round.

- **Layout modes**: `bsp` + `stack` only. `master_stack` /
  `scrolling` / `traditional` are out of scope; future opt-ins.
- **BSP auto-tile**: always-on. A WS in `bsp` mode auto-splits
  the focused window on every new-window event.
- **Split direction**: auto-balance (wider window → vertical
  split, taller → horizontal). New window lands on the
  bottom / right of the resulting split.
- **Floating opt-out**: AX role auto-detection (`AXSheet`,
  `AXDialog`, `AXSystemDialog`, `kAXFloatingWindowSubrole`)
  plus manual `toggleFloat`. Floating windows skip the tree.
- **Manual resize**: lazy retile. facet only re-applies
  tree-computed frames on *tree-changing events* (new window,
  close, mode flip, `--retile`, WS switch). User drags survive
  until the next such event — drag observation + ratio update
  (yabai-style) is a later increment.
- **WS switch (active flip)**: tiled windows go to
  tree-computed frames; floating windows restore from
  `originalPosition` per existing hide flow.
- **Stack mode**: focused window fills the display; others are
  parked at the anchor sliver. `cycleStackNext` /
  `cycleStackPrev` actions move focus; a new window in a stack
  WS becomes the focused / top member.
- **Layout state**: `LayoutTree` value type in
  `FacetAdapterNative`, peer to `WorkspaceCatalog`. Catalog
  composes `layoutTrees: [Int: LayoutTree]` (per-WS, only
  present for `bsp` WSs). Same pattern as the PR-B
  `WorkspaceCatalog` extraction — pure data, no AX, fully
  unit-testable.
- **Multi-display**: unchanged from Phase α. Tree is per-WS,
  WS is per-display; the root rect is the active display's
  `visibleFrame`. No cross-display tree, no display-move action.
- **Gaps / padding**: zero, hardcoded. Config key reserved for
  later if demand surfaces.
- **Directional movement**: only `toggleOrientation` (rotate
  the focused window's parent split). `moveLeft/Right/Up/Down`
  are out of γ.1 scope; tree pathfinding adds enough complexity
  to deserve its own increment.
- **Mode change**: smooth migration — `toggleStack` from BSP
  parks all but focused (at the anchor sliver); the reverse
  re-inserts members in focus order via auto-balance. **Default
  mode for a new WS = `"float"`** (not `"bsp"`) so existing
  users see no surprise behaviour; opt-in per WS via
  `facet workspace --layout bsp` (subject-verb since Theme C #81/#82).
- **CLI surface (5 new verbs)** (reshaped to subject-verb by Theme C #81/#82):
  - `facet workspace --layout NAME` — active WS mode (`bsp` / `stack` / `float`)
  - `facet workspace --retile` — recompute + re-apply the active WS layout
  - `facet window --toggle-float`
  - `facet window --toggle-orientation`
  - `facet window --cycle-stack next|prev`
- **Phasing**: ships as three PRs.
  - **γ.1 BSP core (shipped)** — `LayoutTree`, per-WS mode
    field, BSP auto-tile, manual `toggleFloat`,
    `toggleOrientation`, four of the five CLI verbs + this
    `architecture.md` section.
  - **γ.2 Stack mode (shipped)** — stack implementation +
    cycle ops + the `--cycle-stack` CLI.
  - **γ.3 AX role auto-float (shipped)** — populate
    `isFloating` on new windows whose AX role / subrole is in
    the floating set (`AXSheet`, `AXDrawer`,
    `kAXFloatingWindowSubrole`, `kAXSystemDialogSubrole`,
    `kAXSystemFloatingWindowSubrole`, `kAXDialogSubrole`).
    First-sight hint only — user's manual `toggleFloat` stays
    authoritative.

Memory cross-reference: `facet-phase-gamma-decisions`.

### Phase δ frozen decisions (2026-05-27)

Phase δ design is fully decided. Details live in memory
(`facet-phase-delta-decisions`); this list is the index. **Do
not relitigate** without explicit grill round.

- **Scope interpretation**: `display reconfigure handling +
  persistence-aware geometry`. The "persistence" half does
  NOT add new facet-managed state — it means making sure
  *existing* persisted geometry (panel position) survives
  display reconfiguration without breaking. WS state
  persistence stays out of scope (Phase α frozen "no state
  persistence — config seed only" is preserved).
- **Trigger**: `NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification`
  only. Covers resolution change, arrangement, hot-plug, lid
  open/close, sleep wake — one signal, one handler.
  Fine-grained `CGDisplayRegisterReconfigurationCallback` is
  YAGNI; the response is the same regardless of cause.
- **Handler**: re-tile *active WS only* (lazy retile invariant
  preserved, `facet-phase-gamma-lessons`). Plus: rescue
  `anchorParked` windows whose recorded `originalPosition` is
  no longer on any visible display — move to the nearest
  visible display's anchor sliver. Inactive WS layouts are
  not touched (catch up on next switch).
- **Panel snap fallback**: when the persisted panel rect is
  fully off-screen after a reconfig, snap to the nearest
  visible display's centre (preserving size). Main-display
  reset and default-position reset both rejected — nearest
  matches user intent best.
- **Architecture**: `Sources/FacetAccessibility/DisplayChangeObserver.swift`
  mirrors `WindowEventObserver` (same `init(onChange:)` /
  `start()` / `stop()` shape). Pure geometry helpers in
  `Sources/FacetCore/DisplayGeometry.swift`
  (`orphanedPoints`, `nearestDisplay`, `isVisible`) — pure CGRect
  maths, so they live in FacetCore, not the AX module.
  Controller and NativeAdapter each own their own observer
  instance — backend doesn't notify the controller, each
  handles its own concern (separation maintained).
- **Debounce**: 0.5 s. Reconfig events fire in bursts of 2–3
  notifications; debounce coalesces them into a single
  handler invocation via `DispatchWorkItem` cancel /
  reschedule.
- **Testing strategy**: pure `DisplayGeometry` helpers get
  full unit coverage. `DisplayChangeObserver` lifecycle gets
  1–2 cases (start/stop + debounce). The AX-touching parts
  (NativeAdapter `handleDisplayReconfigure`, PanelHost
  reconfigure response) are acknowledged as untested on the
  current 1-display dev environment; production smoke is
  deferred to multi-display users.
- **PR phasing**: single PR (≈600–800 lines incl. tests).
  Same pattern as γ.1 — pure value type + first consumer in
  one mergeable unit, no orphan-consumer split.

**Single-display dev environment note**: The developer
machine has one display. Multi-display polish isn't pursued
beyond what the rescue helpers naturally cover. The geometry
helpers ARE implemented (they're pure, unit-testable, cheap)
so when multi-display use surfaces — own setup change, user
report — the response logic is already there.

Memory cross-reference: `facet-phase-delta-decisions`.

### Phase ε frozen decisions (2026-05-27)

Phase ε is the M5 finisher: retire the rift adapter, make native
the only backend, bump to v2.0.0. Details live in memory
(`facet-phase-epsilon-decisions`); this section is the index.
**Do not relitigate** without explicit grill round.

- **End state**: `FacetAdapterRift` module is **fully deleted**.
  `FACET_BACKEND` env var is removed as a switch — kept *only*
  as a startup-warning hint so users who had
  `FACET_BACKEND=rift` set in their shell see a `Log.line`
  explaining v2.0 dropped the rift adapter. `rift-cli`
  dependency is gone; the brew formula was always runtime-dep
  free so no formula change.
- **Phasing**: single PR. Deletion-heavy (~1500 line churn,
  almost all subtractions); no intermediate state.
- **`WindowBackend` protocol**: **preserved** as a unit-test
  stub seam (`StubBackend` in `BackendTests`). Surface (`name`,
  `layoutModes`, etc.) kept as protocol-shape expression.
- **Versioning**: major bump v1.x.y → **v2.0.0**. Commit
  message carries `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer so `git-cliff`
  derives the bump automatically. README milestone row
  records "v2.0.0: rift retired".
- **Migration messaging**: friendly hint, not error.
  `FACET_BACKEND=rift` upgrade case prints one `Log.line`
  ("FACET_BACKEND is no longer used; native is the only
  backend"). Silent ignore considered (less helpful) and
  hard error considered (too disruptive); hint is the
  Goldilocks. Warning code itself is removable in a later
  polish PR once v2.0 has settled.
- **Memory**: `rift-restart-gotcha` and
  `rift-workspace-names-config-reapply` are kept as
  historical (`applies to facet ≤ v1.x` banner added); the
  knowledge they carry stays useful for users running rift
  standalone.

Memory cross-reference: `facet-phase-epsilon-decisions`.

## Mapping to Clean Architecture / DDD

facet's 3-layer split is **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** —
which is the same idea Clean Architecture distills into "the
dependency rule: source code dependencies always point inward."
The DDD tactical patterns also fit cleanly even though the code
never spells them out. This table is the rosetta stone so the
two vocabularies don't drift apart:

| Pattern | facet implementation |
|---|---|
| **Clean Architecture — Domain** (Entity + Repository protocol) | `FacetCore` (`Workspace`, `Window`, `WindowID`, `WindowAction`, `WindowBackend` + `WindowCapturing` protocols) |
| **Clean Architecture — Platform / Infrastructure** (Repository impl) | `FacetAdapterNative` (`NativeAdapter`, `WorkspaceCatalog`, `LayoutTree`) + `FacetAccessibility` (AX helpers) + `FacetCapture` (`SCKWindowCapture`, ScreenCaptureKit, behind `WindowCapturing`) |
| **Clean Architecture — Frameworks & Drivers** (UI) | `FacetView`, `FacetViewTree`, `FacetViewGrid`, `FacetViewRail` (AppKit-bound) |
| **Clean Architecture — Application** (DI + Coordinator) | `FacetApp` (`Controller` + `Main`) |
| **Clean Architecture — Use Case (Interactor)** | *NOT a separate layer* — see below |
| **DDD — Entity** | `Workspace`, `Window` |
| **DDD — Value Object** | `WindowID`, `Palette`, `FontKind`, `CGRect` |
| **DDD — Aggregate Root** | `Workspace` (owns its `windows`) |
| **DDD — Repository** | `WindowBackend` protocol (window management) + `WindowCapturing` protocol (image capture) |
| **DDD — Domain Service** | `Focus.assert` / `Focus.withRetry`, `AXTitles.resolve`, `WorkspaceCatalog` reconciliation, `DisplayGeometry` queries, `scaledWindowRect` |
| **DDD — Domain Event** | `BackendEvent` (consumed via `AsyncStream`) |
| **DDD — Bounded Context** | one binary = one context, no inter-context translation needed |

### Why no explicit Use Case layer

Strict Clean Architecture splits *application logic* (use cases /
interactors) from *coordination* (controller). facet collapses
both into `Controller` because at the current view count (3 — tree,
grid, rail) the use-case shapes are 1-line wrappers around backend
calls plus AX retry — a separate layer would be 100% boilerplate.

The third view (rail, #109) landed without duplicating an operation
across view code paths, so YAGNI still holds. If a fourth view lands
(dock, palette, hover-bar) **and**
the same operation (e.g. "switch + focus this window") starts
appearing in two view code paths, that's the signal to extract a
`FacetUseCases` module. Until then, the rule is YAGNI (memory:
[[design-principles]]).

### Why no ViewModels

Clean Architecture / MVVM patterns usually put a ViewModel
between the View and the Use Case. facet's views are `NSView`
subclasses (AppKit), not SwiftUI — the natural seam between
view-state and command dispatch is the `TreeController` /
`OverviewView` callback protocol (the grid + rail both conform to
the latter — snapshot inputs + move/swap/pick callbacks + the common
keyboard verbs; P8-1), which is doing the ViewModel's job without the
boilerplate of a separate type. Same YAGNI logic applies; revisit
when a view needs to be shared across multiple windows or hosts.

## Threading model (catalog serialization, P6)

The native adapter's mutable state — `WorkspaceCatalog` (the active
catalog), `parkedCatalogs` (per-mac-desktop), and the reconcile
bookkeeping (`trustedNew` / `seenWindowIDs` / `pidToBundleId` / …) — is
**confined to one serial queue, `cliQueue`** (`com.facet.backend.queue`).
Every mutate AND read of that state happens there. This is the single
serialization point that makes the `@unchecked Sendable` on `NativeAdapter`
actually sound (the compiler can't verify queue-confinement, so the
discipline is enforced at runtime by `dispatchPrecondition(.onQueue(cliQueue))`
on the catalog entry points).

How the surfaces reach it:

- **CLI / IPC commands** (`Controller`'s DNC observer fires on `.main`)
  hop to cliQueue via `runBackendCommand { bk in … }`; errors + the
  follow-up reconcile hop back to main. The grid / rail / tree / tag-panel
  callbacks already wrap their backend calls in `cliQueue.async`.
- **The poll + AX-event refresh** (`Controller.refresh`) dispatches
  `workspaces()` → `refreshCatalog()` on cliQueue.
- **Display reconfigure** (a `@MainActor` observer) reads the `NSScreen`
  frames on main (a value snapshot), then does all catalog work in
  `cliQueue.async`.
- **`facet query` reads** (`writeStatus` / `writeQuery` /
  `queryFacetStates`) run on cliQueue too — reads tear against the cliQueue
  writers just as writes do, so they are not exempt.

The one-way rule that keeps it deadlock-free:

> **`main → cliQueue` is ALWAYS `.async` (never `.sync`).
> `cliQueue → main` may be `.sync`** — but only for `NSScreen` reads
> (`activeDisplayRect` / `activeScale`), which AppKit pins to main.

Because main never blocks waiting on cliQueue, main is always free to
service the `cliQueue → main` `NSScreen` hop; the edges form no cycle.
Adding a `main → cliQueue` `.sync` anywhere would close the cycle and
deadlock — don't.

Slide animations (枠 E) span both: the command commits the catalog on
cliQueue, then hands a **value** plan (AX elements + frames) to the
main-confined driver via a single `DispatchQueue.main.async`. The driver
and its settle run on main and touch **no catalog** — the settle only
AX-snaps windows to their final frames and yields a refresh. So the slide
clock (`slideAnims` / timer / `slideInProgress`) is main-confined, the
catalog is cliQueue-confined, and the two never share mutable state.
`Controller.refresh` skips while `backend.isAnimating` so a reconcile can't
AX-fight the in-flight tween.

## Section / lens read-path (the pivot)

The default read-path is spatial: windows live in facet workspaces, and a
view renders one cell per workspace. The **pivot** (M11-3 tag model #176,
then the projection re-design #282–#301) adds a second, orthogonal read-path
that renders the config's declared **sections** instead — a window shows up
in every section it matches, not just the one workspace it lives in. The
whole projection / apply surface is pure `FacetCore`, so it is exhaustively
unit-tested and the views stay rendering-only.

### The projection (pure)

`FilterProjection.project(workspaces:sections:)` takes the backend's live
`[Workspace]` and the mac desktop's `[DesktopSection]` config and returns a
`Result` — the renderable `[ProjectedSection]` plus loud-but-non-fatal
diagnostics. Two types are deliberately kept apart:

- **`DesktopSection`** — the *config declaration* (`[[desktop.N.section]]`): a
  required `type` (`workspace` / `lens` / `unassigned`), an optional `label`,
  a raw `match` string, and an `apply` op list.
- **`ProjectedSection`** — the *projection result*: one rendered unit, with a
  stable `id` (`"ws:<index>"` or `"section:<declOrder>:<label>"`), a `label`,
  the `windows` that landed in it, `sourceWorkspaceIndex` (`nil` for a
  multi-match lens), and the `sectionType`. (Was `FilterGroup` until the
  Phase D rename retired the forbidden word `group`.)

Per-type semantics:

- **workspace** — the spatial substrate. Maps positionally onto the live
  workspaces by *wire index* (the k-th workspace section ↔ `workspaces[k]`),
  takes their windows verbatim (no filter eval), carries the layout seed.
- **lens** — a saved filter. Its `match` compiles to a `facet filter` and is
  evaluated over *every* window (multi-match: a window in two lens sections
  appears in both). A lens narrows; it never re-bundles.
- **unassigned** — deferred (every managed window currently has a workspace,
  so the AND-defined unassigned set is always empty); the type decodes but
  the projection emits no section for it yet.

**Degrade is a first-class citizen**: a mac desktop with no sections projects
1:1 to by-workspace, byte-identical to the pre-pivot tree, and an
all-`workspace` config converges to the same result. The gate is
`FacetConfig.isSectionModelActive`.

### The filter language (`facet filter`)

`FacetFilter` is a small, total WHERE-clause language (`parse` → AST →
`matches`, with a `description` inverse). A lens `match` is one of these; the
projection overlays the window's workspace name (`ProjectedWindowFields`) so
`match='workspace=Dev'` resolves at the seam. A malformed match is
loud-but-non-fatal (skipped + a diagnostic caret), matching the CLI
philosophy. The tag-mode **lens** mask itself is expressible as a filter
(`TagModel.lensFilter`, parity-only — the `UInt64` bitmask stays
authoritative; the filter form is a dead-but-tested read-only projection).

### The mutating read-path (`ApplyResolver`, pure)

Dragging a window onto a section (or right-clicking "Add to ▸ lens") routes
through `ApplyResolver` — the pure brain that turns a section id + the dropped
window into an executable `Plan` (`un-apply(source) → apply(dest)` for a MOVE,
apply-only for an ADD). It validates the core invariant — the window must
satisfy the dest section's `match` *after* the apply — and returns an inert
plan (snap-back, no backend op) when it can't; the Controller dispatches a
non-inert plan's ops on `cliQueue`.

### Where it is consumed

The tree (`SidebarView.update(sections:)`) renders `[ProjectedSection]`
directly. The active section-lens is a REAL hide and **cross-workspace
exclusive** (EX-0): the catalog anchor-parks the out-of-lens windows across
ALL workspaces (not just the active one) and the snapshot flags each
`Window.isLensParked`, so the tree dims + `lens`-badges those rows while
grid / rail drop their thumbnails — one catalog authority, no view-side
`match` recompute. The read-path is **LIVE under `[grouping] by =
"workspace"`**; under `by = "tag"` sections are ignored
(`effectiveMacDesktopSectionConfigs` clamps to empty — a tag world owns its
own lens instead).

### Two tiling machineries, one active section

There is always **exactly one** [active section](glossary.md#active-section)
— `activeSection := activeLens (type=lens) XOR activeWorkspace`. Which kind is
active selects which tiling machinery runs over the windows:

| | `type=workspace` | `type=lens` |
|---|---|---|
| Frames | stateful `applyLayout` on `activeIndex` | stateless `sectionLensUnionFrames(layout:in:)` |
| Member set | per-WS members (the active workspace's own windows) | cross-WS `sectionLensUnionMembers()` (every matching window in any workspace) |
| Layout source | per-WS `layoutMode` (stateful — bsp/stack carry tree/order state) | the lens `layout` key (stateless engines only; `bsp` / `stack` clamp to the global `[layout]` default) |

`ActiveSection` selects the machinery (`activeSectionLens != nil` → the lens
union machinery; else the workspace machinery). The catalog enforces the XOR
structurally — every workspace switch nulls the active lens, so the two
machineries are never live at once.

All **three views render this one ordered section list** (`FilterProjection.project`
→ `[ProjectedSection]`): the tree's section headers, the grid's cells, and the
rail's carousel cells (with the active/selected section as the centre **hero** —
an active lens renders its union there). Each lights **exactly one** section, the
active one — **3-view unified highlight**, completed across tree (EX-1), grid
(EX-2a), and rail (EX-2b). `OverviewCell.isActive` bakes the single-highlight XOR
at cell-build time, so the accent draw is identical across surfaces; cell/window
picks funnel through `WindowBackend.activateSection` (the same throughline the CLI
+ tree use). Lens cells are browsable but never drag/swap targets (no source
workspace).

## Non-goals

- **SIP-disabled features in `facet`** — out of scope.
  Mouse-follows-focus / true hide / programmable mac desktops / etc.
  all require SIP off + Dock.app injection, which conflicts with
  facet's "釈迦の掌の上" philosophy (`facet-buddha-palm-principle`).
  If a user genuinely needs them, the answer is a separate
  fork — not a bolt-on in this repo (`facet-deep-core-deferred-to-fork`
  memory).
- **Cross-platform** — macOS-only. Swift + native APIs are the
  comfortable spot.
- **Keyboard shortcut management** — out of scope. facet exposes
  CLI; users wire shortcuts via skhd / Karabiner-Elements /
  hammerspoon (see `facet-cli-surface` memory). This mirrors
  yabai's separation from skhd.
- **App-based rules engine** ("Chrome → WS 2", etc.) — out of
  scope. facet operates window-by-window. New windows land in the
  current active WS; user moves them with `facet window
  --move-to N`.
- **Persistence of workspace state across restart** — out of
  scope for facet itself. WS names are not persisted (auto-named
  emoji); a `[[desktop.N.section]]` block only seeds the WS count +
  per-WS `layout` (read-only). Runtime rename / layout / catalog
  mutations are session-only by design.
- **Plugin / extension system, menubar icon, system notifications,
  theme editor GUI, window snapping, global hotkey reservation,
  screen recording, animation customization, UI translation
  (i18n)** — all 9 explicitly rejected 2026-05-24
  (`facet-scope-exclusions` memory). Compose with shell tools or
  do without.
