// Top-level orchestrator. Wires:
//   - a ``WindowBackend`` (``FacetAdapterNative``, sole backend since v2.0.0)
//   - the tree view (``SidebarView``) + its panel chrome
//     (``PanelHost``)
//   - the grid view + its overlay lifecycle
//   - the event stream (``backend.events`` → AsyncStream Task →
//     debounced refresh) and a periodic poll fallback for backends
//     that don't emit
//   - ``AXTitles`` resolve to fill in titles the backend left blank
//   - the focus retry state machine (``Focus.withRetry`` /
//     ``Focus.assert``)
//   - keyboard-nav + search
//   - distributed-notification CLI IPC
//
// Conforms to ``TreeController`` so ``SidebarView`` can talk to it
