// `OverviewProjection` — narrow the grid/rail overview to the active lens.
//
// The pivot's grid/rail surfaces render the SPATIAL substrate: one cell per
// workspace, always (`type="lens"` / `type="unassigned"` sections never make
// a cell — "grid/rail に出せる ⟺ workspace に乗ってる"). A lens only NARROWS
// what's shown inside those cells; it never re-bundles or drops a cell. So
// this projection keeps the workspace set 1:1 (same count / order / index /
// name / layout) and only filters each workspace's `windows` to the ones the
// active lens's `match` selects. The grid/rail cell count is therefore
// INVARIANT under a lens (トミー 2026-06-17: lens = SQL VIEW, orthogonal to
// the workspace axis).
//
// Pure + backend-neutral (unit-tested in `FacetCoreTests`); the Controller
// derives a visible-window-id set from the result and feeds it (live) to
// whichever overview is open. The landing gate (`OverviewPendingDrop.landed`)
// keeps reading the UNFILTERED `[Workspace]`, never this result — a window
// moved out of the lens's selection would otherwise never appear in the
// filtered destination and the drop would stay stuck forever.
//
// Tag-unification Phase 1: an active lens is now a REAL hide — the backend
// anchor-parks the out-of-lens windows in the ACTIVE workspace. This cosmetic
// narrow is therefore COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant: in the active workspace it
// hides the parked windows' sliver thumbnails, and in an inactive workspace it
// PREDICTS the post-switch view (those windows aren't parked yet). Both use the
// same membership predicate (`LensMembership`) as the real park, so the
// preview and the hide can't disagree. (Reflecting the real park in grid/rail
// + retiring any genuinely-redundant narrow is PR-4 work.)
//
// DEGRADE — no active lens (`match == nil`): the workspaces pass through
// VERBATIM (every window visible), so the section-less / lens-inactive
// overview renders byte-identically to today.
//
// Loud-but-NON-FATAL (the `facet filter` philosophy, see `FilterProjection`):
// a `match` that fails to parse, or references an unknown field, does NOT
// empty the overview — the workspaces pass through verbatim (everything
// visible) and the reason is collected in `diagnostics` for the caller to
// log. A broken filter showing everything is far less alarming than an
// all-empty overview that looks like facet lost every window.
