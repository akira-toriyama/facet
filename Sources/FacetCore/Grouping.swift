// Window grouping paradigm (M11-3) — pure, unit-testable.
//
// facet groups windows one of two ways, chosen once at startup via
// `[grouping] by` and fixed for the session:
//
//   - `workspace` (default): one window belongs to one facet
//     workspace. The historical model.
//   - `tag`: one window carries a SET of tags; a `lens` (the current
//     view mask) shows the union of windows whose tags intersect it
//     (dwm-style `tags & viewmask`). Static: tags are defined in
//     config and frozen at window appearance (no runtime re-tag).
//
// The value is an open vocabulary on purpose — a future grouping
// paradigm (e.g. scrollable columns) is one more case, mirroring the
// `--view=NAME` symmetric pattern. An unknown `by` is a loud config
// error, never a silent fallback.

/// How facet groups windows. Chosen at startup (`[grouping] by`),
/// fixed for the session — change it and restart.
